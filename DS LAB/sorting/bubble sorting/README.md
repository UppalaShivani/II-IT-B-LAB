# Aim : 
To write a program to perform bubble sort operation for the given list of integers
# Description :
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.                                                                                   
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n*n), best case is O(n)                           
# Step-by-step procedure : 
### Case-1: 
array = [2,5,9,3,1]
