# Aim : 
To write a program to perform bubble sort operation for the given list of integers
# Description :
Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.                                                                                   
Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of Ðž(n*n), best case is O(n)                           
# Step-by-step procedure : 
### Case-1: 
array = [2,5,9,3,1]                                                                                       
It is an unsorted array ,so it starts by comparing with first 2 elements.                                 
Iteration 1 :                                                                                             
2 is compared with 5, 2 is small then 5 so no swaping takes place                                         
Then 5,9 are compared , 5 < 9 so no swaping takes place.                                                   
Then 9,3 are compared , 9 > 3 so swaping takes place and array becomes as [2,5,3,9,1]                     
Finally 9,1 are compared, 9 > 1 so swaping takes place and array becomes as [2,5,3,1,9]                   
Iteration 2 :
2 is compared with 5, 2 is small then 5 so no swaping takes place                                         
Then 5,3 are compared , 5 > 3 so swaping takes place and array becomes as [2,3,5,1,9]                     
Then 5,1 are compared , 5 > 1 so swaping takes place and array becomes as [2,3,1,5,9]                     
Finally 5,9 are compared, 9 > 5 so no swaping takes place.                                                
Iteration 3 :
2 is compared with 3, 2 is small then 3 so no swaping takes place                                         
Then 3,1 are compared , 3 > 1 so swaping takes place and array becomes as [2,1,3,5,9].                     
Then 3,5 are compared , 5 > 3 so no swaping takes place                                                   
Finally 5,9 are compared, 9 > 5 so no swaping takes place.                                                 
Iteration 3 :
2 is compared with 1, 2 is greater then 1 so swaping takes place and arry becomes as [1,2,3,5,9].         
Then 2,3 are compared , 2 < 3 so no swaping takes place.                                                   
Then 3,5 are compared , 5 > 3 so no swaping takes place                                                   
Finally 5,9 are compared, 9 > 5 so no swaping takes place
Iteration 4 :
Here the array is sorted ,so no swaping takes place and it comes out of loop.                             
#### Output of following case is : [1,2,3,5,9].
