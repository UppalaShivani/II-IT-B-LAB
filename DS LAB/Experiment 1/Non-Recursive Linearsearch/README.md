# Aim :
To write a program using non-recursive function to perform Linear search operations for a Key value in a given list of integers.
# Description :
Linear search in C to find whether a number is present in an array. If it's present, then at what location it occurs. It is also known as a sequential search.
It is straightforward and works as follows:
1. Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2. If x matches with an element, return the index of that element.
3. If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, then it return -1.

The time required to search an element using the algorithm depends on the size of the list. In the best case, it's present at the beginning of the list, in the worst-case, element is present at the end. Its time complexity is O(n).
# Step-by-step procedure :
1. List of integers : arr[] = {10,6,8,15,20,3,14,99,66,30}.                                                                       
End_Index = 9
## Case-1 : Key element = 66.                                                                                                     
2. In this program the Key element is compared with each element. When the Keyelement = element ig array it returns the position of that element in th array.
